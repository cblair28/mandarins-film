      Director's Statement
    </h1>
    <div class="Hero-description">
      Mandarins was inspired by the mothers and daughters in my life. As a biracial woman with a Chinese immigrant mother, my connection to my Asian culture and heritage has been primarily through her. Though our relationship was tumultuous at times, as many parent-child relationships can be, I came to realize there was an added layer of cultural nuance to our conflicts - one that only other Asian Americans seemed to understand.
      <br><br>
      In college, I began to grow more curious about my mother. We started having conversations about her past that would continue long into the night. As we became closer, I developed an understanding of the trauma she went through, not only as a Chinese woman born into poverty, but also at the hands of her own parents - my Gong Gong and Popo. I realized many of our conflicts stemmed from these childhood experiences of hers and her ability to show me love was even more profound when I learned she had never been told “I love you” by her mother. As I continued to unravel my family’s history, I discovered the traumas that my Popo and other relatives had faced - being prohibited from learning to read or write, subjected to foot-binding, excluded from inheritances due to gender. It became clear I was not the only one with grievances towards my ancestors and what I was experiencing was only a link in the long chain of generational trauma.
      <br><br>
      Mandarins is not just a story about hurting and conflict. Despite the hardships the Chinese women in my life have faced, they remain fiercely loyal to their families. They embody an unresolved, aching forgiveness. This film is an ode to the wonderfully imperfect women in my life and a love letter to a uniquely American culture where relocated communities gather in transformed church basements to preserve their heritage and history. It is an acknowledgement of the pain experienced by a group who have been historically discriminated against, endured the hardship of immigration, and felt the trauma of poverty - and the echoes of this pain that still haunt their American-born descendents.
      <br><br>
      Through the setting of a funeral, Mandarins grapples with the conundrum of forgiveness across generations, fraught by lack of closure and requital, and considers the ways we can, as individuals and as a community, forgive and love our ancestors while still honoring our pain.
