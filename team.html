              By day, Nathan is a DC-based commercial director at January Third; a small but mighty creative agency that focuses on making memorable content for brands across the world. By night, Nathan is a narrative director and cinematographer that focuses on telling stories that are usually a little insane, WAY too ambitious, and always grounded in something personal. He values fostering strong creative partnerships and thrives off of keeping a positive energy on set. Fun fact: if a picture is worth a thousand words, then the average film is approximately worth 133,920,000 words which probably means I should've paid more attention in school.
